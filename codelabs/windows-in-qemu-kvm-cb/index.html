      <google-codelab-step label="Technical terms" duration="3">
        <p>Throughout this guide, you&#39;ll see certain words and phrases used to describe what we&#39;re trying to achieve here, as well as in the steps required to reach our goal. Here is a brief introduction for some of those terms:</p>
<p><strong>Container</strong>: a self-contained package of software, essentially a virtualized environment, that allows you to run Linux applications on a ChromeOS device with isolation from the main system.</p>
<p><strong>Crosh</strong>: think of this as Chrome Shell ... crosh is a command-shell environment for ChromeOS. Most Linux commands are locked down inside Crosh, i.e. sudo does <em>not</em> work.</p>
<p><strong>Crostini</strong>: think of this as <em>true</em> Linux on ChromeOS. Allows you to run Linux apps (primarily for development) alongside your usual ChromeOS desktop and apps. Linux on Chromebooks offers developers the best of both worlds.</p>
<p><strong>Domain</strong>: in this context, virtual machines are sometimes referred to (mainly in documentation) as domains.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: in relation to Host below, a guest is a virtual machine running on a host machine.</p>
<p><strong>Host</strong>: the bare-metal hardware on which a hypervisor will run &#34;guest&#34; virtual machines.</p>
<p><strong>Hypervisor</strong>: a program used to run and manage one or more virtual machines on a computer.</p>
<p><strong>KVM</strong>: Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is an open-source virtualization technology for Linux operating systems. With KVM, Linux can function as a hypervisor that runs multiple, isolated, virtual machines (VMs).</p>
<p><strong>Libvirt</strong>: Libvirt is a collection of software that provides a convenient way to manage virtual machines and other virtualization functionality, such as storage and network interface management. These software implementations include an API library, a daemon (libvirtd), and a command-line utility (virsh).</p>
<p><strong>Qcow2</strong>: (QEMU Copy-On-Write version 2) is a versatile disk-image format that supports features like compression, snapshots, and thin provisioning.</p>
<p><strong>QEMU</strong>: the Quick Emulator (QEMU) is a free and open-source emulator that uses dynamic binary translation to emulate a computer&#39;s processor; that is, it translates the emulated binary codes to an equivalent binary format which is executed by the machine. It provides a variety of hardware and device models for the virtual machine, enabling it to run different guest operating systems.</p>
<p><strong>Termina</strong> (not a typo ... mainly used internally): a VM image, with a stripped-down Linux kernel and user-land tools, developed by the ChromeOS team. Its only goal is to boot up as quickly as possible and start running containers.</p>
<p><strong>Terminal</strong>: on ChromeOS, the Terminal is the main entry point into Linux, and the main way for you to interact with your development environment by running Linux command-line tools.</p>
<p><strong>VHD</strong>: a Virtual Hard-Disk is a file format that acts as a virtual hard drive, allowing you to store operating systems and data as if it were a physical disk.</p>
<p><strong>Virt-Manager</strong>: the virt-manager application (Virtual Machine Manager) is a desktop user interface for managing virtual machines through libvirt. It primarily targets KVM VMs, but also manages Xen and LXC (Linux Containers). It presents a summary view of running domains, with their live performance and resource utilization statistics. Wizards enable the creation of new domains, and configuration/adjustment of a domain&#39;s resource allocation and virtual hardware. An embedded VNC and SPICE client viewer presents a full graphical console to the guest domain.</p>
<p><strong>VM</strong>: short for Virtual Machine, a VM is a <em>virtualized</em> operating system (or machine), in that the O/S is running as a <em>guest</em> on virtualized hardware, supplied and managed by the <em>host</em> (the actual computer that is running the hypervisor software).</p>
<aside class="warning"><p><strong>Be aware</strong> of the difference between <strong>Crosh</strong> and <strong>Termina</strong> ... Crosh is the built-in command shell environment on ChromeOS, allowing users to run very basic commands directly within the operating system, while Termina refers to a specific virtual machine image used on ChromeOS for running containers, essentially providing a more robust Linux environment for advanced tasks, like container management</p>

<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Update system</strong></h2>
<p>Before installing any major software, it&#39;s always a good idea to update your local packages/versions list, then carry out any system upgrades.</p>
<p>Start by opening a Linux Terminal window and running the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade</code></pre>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Install hypervisor</strong></h2>
<p>Next, we&#39;ll install the required software and dependencies, using this command:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install qemu-kvm virt-manager</code></pre>
<p>When the installation is complete, you should see a new icon in the <strong>Linux apps</strong> folder in your ChromeOS menu. Do <strong>not</strong> start the program yet though ... there&#39;s just one step we have to perform first, in the next section.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Set up ISOs share</strong></h2>
<p>To save space inside your VMs, and avoid possible duplicates, it&#39;s a good idea to store your <strong>.iso</strong> files in a separate folder in ChromeOS, then share that folder with Linux.</p>
<p>To do that, start by opening the <strong>Files</strong> app, and creating a folder called <strong>ISOs</strong> under the <strong>Downloads</strong> directory, then right-click the folder and select <strong>Share with Linux</strong> from the menu.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Set up VMs share</strong></h2>
<p>For similar reasons as above, and to make backups of your Linux environment smaller/quicker, we will store our virtual hard-disk (.qcow2) files in a separate folder in ChromeOS, and share that folder with Linux as well.</p>
<p>This time, create a folder named <strong>VMs</strong> in the root of your home directory, i.e. under My files. You should end up with a folder hierarchy similar to the following:</p>
<p><strong>My files</strong></p>
<p>|-- Downloads</p>
<p>|--|-- <strong>ISOs</strong></p>
<p>|-- Linux files</p>
<p>|-- <strong>VMs</strong></p>
<p>When you are ready, right-click the folder and select <strong>Share with Linux</strong> from the menu.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Download Windows</strong></h2>
<p>If you haven&#39;t done so already, now would be a good time to download the <strong>.iso</strong> file for whichever version of Windows you&#39;re going to install. These links might be helpful:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO" target="_blank">Windows 10</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11" target="_blank">Windows 11</a></p>
<p>When you have the file, move it into the <strong>Downloads\ISOs</strong> folder that you created earlier. You should now have a file/folder hierarchy similar the following (the actual <em>filename</em> is not important):</p>
<p><strong>My files<br></strong>|-- Downloads<br>|--|-- <strong>ISOs<br></strong>|--|--|-- Win11_24H2_English_x64.iso</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="QEMU Settings" duration="2">
        <p>With qemu-kvm, virt-manager, and their dependencies installed, we need to make some alterations to the settings file for QEMU, specifically <strong>/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf</strong> before running virt-manager (Virtual Machine Manager) for the first time.</p>
<p>In this demo, we will use the simple <strong>nano</strong> text-editor ... but, we&#39;ll need to install it first, as it&#39;s not included in the ChromeOS implementation of Debian.</p>
<p>Open your terminal, and run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install nano</code></pre>
<p>Once it&#39;s installed, open the settings file with nano:</p>
<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf</code></pre>
<p>For the following lines, uncomment each line (remove the preceding #), then edit their values to reflect the following settings:</p>
<pre>security_driver = &#34;none&#34;
user = &#34;root&#34;
group = &#34;root&#34;
remember_owner = 0
cgroup_device_acl = []</pre>
<aside class="special"><p><strong>Tip</strong>: as of this writing, <code>security_driver</code> appears on line number 493 ... use the<br><strong>Go To Line</strong> feature to jump down to that position in the <strong>/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf</strong> file.</p>
<p>Also, you may leave the default values as is (for reference later) if you wish,<br>and just add a new line beneath each key/value pair with the desired value</p>
</aside>
<p>If you&#39;re interested in what each of these settings does, read the accompanying notes within the file</p>

        <h2 is-upgraded><strong>Group membership</strong></h2>
<p>For convenience, the next thing you should do is add your <strong>Linux</strong> username to the <strong>libvirt</strong> group ... this will save you from having to enter your password when starting virt-manager. To achieve this, just type the following command in your Linux Terminal:</p>
<pre><code>sudo usermod -a $USER -G libvirt</code></pre>

Now, you can switch back to the VM by selecting <strong>Console</strong> from the <strong>View</strong> menu.</p>
<p>Now that the installer phase is complete, Windows will ask you for a few details. Start by choosing your <strong>Country or Region</strong>, if not already selected, then click <strong>Yes</strong>:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/492d75e781aeb5bb.png"></p>
<p>Next, select your <strong>keyboard layout</strong>, and click <strong>Yes</strong> when ready:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/d5c3ece69a00985d.png"></p>
<p>Add a <strong>second keyboard layout</strong> (if desired) ... or just click <strong>Skip</strong>:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/92bcf391bdd24466.png"></p>
<p>When you reach the <strong>Networking</strong> section, if you followed the steps to disable updates during install, you&#39;ll be able to choose <strong>I don&#39;t have Internet</strong>:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/7961badc70b950a3.png"></p>
<p>However, if networking is <em>still</em> active, then you&#39;ll be prompted for a computer name (for the network). Enter a <strong>name</strong> for this PC, then click <strong>Next</strong> ... the installer will restart:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/e994421f93e48050.png"></p>
<p>Select the <strong>primary use</strong> for this PC, then click <strong>Next</strong>:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/ea67691f282b37ec.png"></p>
<p>Enter a <strong>username</strong> ... by default, this user will be added to the Administrator&#39;s group:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/bd8f293b63055963.png"></p>
<p>Enter a <strong>password</strong> (if desired) and click <strong>Next</strong>:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/873aef36f9384e20.png"></p>
<p>Enable or disable your preferred <strong>Privacy settings</strong> and click <strong>Next</strong>:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/7809dde330be6708.png"></p>
<p>That&#39;s it ... you are now running Windows within your Chromebook:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/4748f2405223198e.png"></p>
<p>Open a <strong>Windows Explorer</strong> window and go to <strong>This PC</strong> ... <strong>eject the Windows installer</strong> &#34;CD-ROM&#34; then go to the next section, where you&#39;ll download and insert <em>another</em> .iso file as a virtual CD-ROM:</p>

<aside class="special"><p>Note in the screenshot how much disk space is used by a new VM running Windows 11 Pro (no updates during install) ... 16.7 GB vs 19.7 GB (updated during install, and can take up to 1 hour)</p>

        <p>Please read <em>at least</em> the first 4 paragraphs on this page, so you can get an overview of what we&#39;re trying to achieve in this section.</p>
<p>For any operating system to function at its peak, it needs to have the correct drivers installed, <em>and</em> we want to ensure that we download those drivers from a reputable source. The good people at the Fedora Project have a VirtIO drivers ISO file that we can download, then use to install these drivers.</p>
<aside class="warning"><p>You might be thinking ... hang on, we&#39;re installing on a Debian based O/S ... yes, our VM is running on top of a Linux hypervisor, but these drivers are for the Windows operating system</p>
</aside>
<p>Start by going to this <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/creating-windows-virtual-machines-using-virtio-drivers/index.html" target="_blank">Fedora Project</a> webpage using your ChromeOS browser, and follow the link next to <strong>For details on downloading the drivers</strong> ... this will take you to their GitHub page for the VirtIO drivers.</p>
<p>On their GitHub page, under the <strong>Downloads</strong> heading, click the link for <strong>Stable virt-win ISO</strong> ... save the file to the <em>same</em> folder as your Windows ISO file.</p>
<aside class="special"><p>The drivers are available on <em>other</em> websites across the web, but we&#39;re doing it <em>this</em> way so that you can see that these files are being obtained from a reputable source</p>
</aside>
<p>Assuming your Windows virtual machine is still running, and you ejected the Windows installer CD-ROM gracefully, you can now adjust the settings for this VM by going to <strong>Virtual Machine Manager</strong> and selecting <strong>Details</strong> from the <strong>View</strong> menu ... in the left-hand column, select <strong>SATA CDROM 1</strong> then click the <strong>Browse</strong> button on the right.</p>
<p>In the same way that we selected the Windows .iso earlier, in the <strong>Locate ISO media volume</strong> dialog, click <strong>ISOs</strong> once to highlight it, then <strong>double-click</strong> the <strong>virtio-win-x.x.xxx.iso</strong> file that you just downloaded ... this will effectively insert the ISO image as a virtual CD-ROM.</p>
<aside class="warning"><p>You may have to click the <strong>Refresh</strong> button to show all files, including the new .iso</p>
</aside>
<p>Back in the Windows VM, open <strong>Windows Explorer</strong> and navigate to the <strong>CD-ROM</strong> drive ... there, you should see the <strong>virtio-win-guest-tools.exe</strong> installer. Double-click this file to launch it. Follow the prompts to install the drivers, just like installing any other software:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/aae7e190ea2b00f1.png"></p>
<p>You&#39;ll need to <strong>Accept</strong> the licensing terms before continuing</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/db856f473dcae045.png"></p>
<p>Accept the defaults, or pick and choose which drivers to install</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/6ecb2c78ed59a6e5.png"></p>
<p>Windows will show a User Account Control prompt ... click <strong>Yes</strong> to continue</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/7cee735003a84fb7.png"></p>
<p>When the installation if complete, restart the VM for all changes to take effect</p>

        <h2 is-upgraded><strong>Automated install or Script</strong></h2>
<p>You might want to test various O/S versions, or be able to quickly create a VM using a bash script. Here is a sample command to automate a VM installation:</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>each VM <strong>name</strong> and .qcow2 <strong>filename</strong> must be unique</li>
<li>the backslashes allow breaking up (what would otherwise be) a <strong>very long command-line</strong> into several human-readable lines</li>
<li>although the VM <em>does</em> still start automatically, the <code>noautoconsole</code> parameter just prevents virt-manager from opening the VM in a not-very-helpful Virtual Machine Viewer</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>virt-install \
  --name Win11 \
  --ram 8192 \
  --disk path=/mnt/chromeos/MyFiles/VMs/win11.qcow2,size=60 \
  --check disk_size=off \
  --vcpus 4 \
  --os-variant win11 \
  --cdrom /mnt/chromeos/ISOs/Win11_24H2_English_x64.iso \
  --noautoconsole</code></pre>
<p>For more details on this command and available options, type <code>virt-install --help</code> in your Linux Terminal</p>
<aside class="special"><p><strong>Tip</strong>: pipe the help output to a text file, for future reference</p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Clone a Virtual Machine</strong></h2>
<p>Here is a sample command to make an exact copy of an existing VM (new <strong>name</strong> and <strong>filename</strong> must be unique):</p>
<pre><code>virt-clone \
  --original Win11 \
  --name Win11v2 \
  --file /mnt/chromeos/MyFiles/VMs/win11v2.qcow2</code></pre>
<p>For more details on this command and available options, type <code>virt-clone --help</code> in your Linux Terminal</p>

        <h2 is-upgraded><strong>Actual file sizes</strong></h2>
<p>With the .qcow2 file format, Linux only displays the <strong>total disk size</strong>, in both file managers and on the command-line. To find out the <strong>actual disk space</strong> used, use the <strong>qemu-img</strong> command, as shown in this example:</p>
<pre><code>sudo qemu-img info /mnt/chromeos/MyFiles/VMs/win11.qcow2</code></pre>
<p>Sample output:</p>
<pre>image: win11.qcow2
file format: qcow2
virtual size: 128 GiB (137438953472 bytes)
disk size: 16.3 GiB
cluster_size: 65536
