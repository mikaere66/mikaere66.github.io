<h2 is-upgraded><strong>About CLaaT (Codelabs as a Thing)</strong></h2>
<p>Code(what?) ... the concept of codelabs is a <strong>learning by doing</strong> approach to education and tutorials.</p>
<p>Rather than have your audience lose interest by presenting them with a long-winded &#34;how to&#34; or a tedious &#34;wiki page&#34;, you can format an easy-to-follow guide in the form of a step-by-step <em>codelab</em>.</p>
<p>Developed and <strong>maintained by a small group of dedicated Googlers</strong> (Google employees), the <code>CLaaT</code> (Codelabs as a Thing) project is open source, and available for anyone to use.</p>
<p>Note: this format is <strong>not restricted to just coding</strong>! You could author a codelab to represent <em>any</em> type of tutorial. It may be related to Car Maintenance, Home Improvement, Operating Systems, PC Upgrades ... the possibilities are endless.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>How do I create my own Codelabs?</strong></h2>
<p>There are actually <em>two</em> different formats supported: .doc (Google Docs) and .md (Markdown Syntax). However, <strong>we will only be discussing the </strong><code>Google Docs</code> <strong>version</strong> ... please refer to my <a href="https://mikaere66.github.io" target="_blank">other Codelabs</a> for the <code>Markdown</code> version.</p>
<p>* <strong>Google Documents</strong>: the content for <em>this</em> type of codelab-authoring can be written in Google Docs, using some simple formatting conventions. Google docs files can be stored in your Google Drive account, but <em>not</em> hosted there ... refer to the Conclusion/Hosting section for more on that topic.<br>Google Docs has the advantage of supporting collaboration, so it would be great for a team</p>
<p>* <strong>Markdown Language</strong>: you can also author codelabs using markdown syntax. Mark(what?) ... Wikipedia describes Markdown as a lightweight <em>markup</em> language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.<br>Markdown has the advantage of being stored locally, so it can be edited even when offline</p>
<aside class="special"><p><strong>Markup</strong> is a generic term for <em>any language</em> that describes a document&#39;s formatting.</p>
<p><strong>Markdown</strong> is a specific <em>markup language</em>, originally created by John Gruber in 2004</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Software prerequisites" duration="15">
        <h2 is-upgraded><strong>Target computers for Software</strong></h2>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Linux</strong></h3>
<p>The following steps include instructions for <strong>Linux</strong> computers, and for Linux in a container, i.e. the <strong>Linux development environment</strong> on a Chromebook, or <strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux</strong> on a Windows PC. If you&#39;re using a fully-fledged Linux distribution installed on your computer, then skip to the <strong>Go</strong> installation, just below ... however, if you&#39;re using a Chromebook or a Windows PC, please read on:</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Chromebook</h3>
<p>If you&#39;re using a <strong>Chromebook</strong>, never fear because the installation of <em>all</em> dependencies has been tested by the author of this tutorial, by following the <strong>Linux instructions</strong> in this guide, within a Linux terminal (Debian Bookworm) on <strong>ChromeOS</strong>. There are <em>some</em> caveats however, which will be outlined (<em>if applicable</em>) as we proceed ... if you have <strong>not yet installed</strong> the <strong>Linux development environment</strong> on your Chromebook, please see my <a href="https://mikaere66.github.io" target="_blank">other Guides</a> on how to achieve this (although, read the next two paragraphs before rushing off).</p>
<p>By installing all of these dependencies in your Linux container, you may get a message from ChromeOS saying <strong>Linux is low on disk space</strong> ... in that popup, there should be a button for <strong>Resize Linux disk</strong>. About two-thirds of the way down the <strong>Linux development environment</strong> settings page, next to <strong>Disk size</strong>, click the <strong>Change</strong> button. In there, drag the slider to the right to increase the allocated disk space to at least <strong>6.0</strong> GB.</p>
<p>Also worth noting is that nano is <em>not</em> installed by default ... if you want to use nano as the plain-text editor for system files (e.g. <code>.bashrc</code>), please install it using the following commands:</p>
<p>Start by updating your actual Debian <strong>system</strong> (recommended):</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade</code></pre>
<aside class="special"><p>Tip: if <strong>major</strong> upgrades were installed above, it might be best to restart your <code>Terminal</code> session. To do that, right-click the <strong>Terminal</strong> icon on your Shelf and select <code>Shut down Linux</code> ... then wait about 10 seconds before restarting</p>
</aside>
<p>When you&#39;re ready, install <strong>nano</strong> using the following command:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install -y nano</code></pre>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Windows</strong></h3>
<p>If you&#39;re using a <strong>Windows desktop or laptop</strong>, then you&#39;ll need to have <strong>WSL2</strong> installed, and a distro already set up. If you need help with that, please see my <a href="https://mikaere66.github.io" target="_blank">other Guides</a> on how to install <strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux</strong>.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Go (with Curl) installation</h2>
<p>The following software is required on your local computer, to &#34;build&#34; the codelab&#39;s output files (HTML by default):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Go</strong> (golang). Requires curl for install</li>
<li><strong>CLaaT</strong> (codelabs command-line tool)</li>
</ul>
<p>Curl is a command-line tool for transferring data with URL syntax, supporting <em>many</em> web protocols ... it&#39;s required to install Go in the next step, as well as Node.js (if applicable).</p>
<p>To check for curl on your system, run the following command in your terminal:</p>
<pre>which curl</pre>
<p><strong>If you receive output</strong> showing the full-path to curl, then skip to the next step.</p>
<p>However, <strong>if there is no output</strong>, install curl from your distro&#39;s repos, as shown:</p>
<p>Start by updating your repos ...<br>(if you haven&#39;t done so already):</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update</code></pre>
<p>Then install the curl program:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install curl</code></pre>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Now you can install Go</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Start by <a href="https://go.dev/dl/" target="_blank">downloading the latest version</a> from the official Go website</li>
<li>Then follow their <a href="https://go.dev/doc/install" target="_blank">installation instructions</a> using this separate link<br>(remember to select the tab for <strong>Linux</strong> installation instructions)</li>
</ul>
<aside class="warning"><p>Important: note that <strong>both</strong> commands for step #1 require<br><strong>elevated </strong>privileges (i.e. <code>sudo rm ... && sudo tar ...</code>)<br>Observe how <code>sudo</code> is called <strong>twice</strong> in the example above.</p>
<p>You will have to close/reopen any command prompt<br>windows <em>before</em> running the <code>go version</code> command</p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>CLaaT tool installation</strong></h2>
<p>The claat executable program converts your input file (e.g. <em>your</em> exercises codelab file) into the actual <code>codelab</code> format, which is HTML by default.</p>
<p>Assuming you have Go installed now, the command below will result in <code>claat</code> having the full path: <code>$HOME/go/bin/claat</code> ... note that executable permissions will already be set, using this method</p>
<pre>go install github.com/googlecodelabs/tools/claat@latest</pre>
<p>Or, download directly from the <a href="https://github.com/googlecodelabs/tools/releases/latest" target="_blank">Google Codelabs</a> GitHub page. No matter which O/S you are using for your bare-metal machine, be sure to select the Linux version, most likely <code>claat-linux-amd64</code></p>
<aside class="warning"><p>Whether you choose to download CLaaT directly from GitHub, or install it using <strong>go</strong>, you&#39;ll need to add its path to your <strong>.bashrc</strong> file, as mentioned in the Environment/Variables section. For ease-of-use, either <em>rename your downloaded file</em> to <code>claat</code> <strong>or </strong><em>create an alias</em> for <code>claat-linux-amd64</code> ... remember to <em>grant permissions</em> to make the file executable, as shown in the example below:</p>
</aside>
<pre>chmod u+x /path-to/claat</pre>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Environment/variables" duration="3">
        <h3 is-upgraded><strong>Checking the path where CLaaT was installed</strong></h3>
<pre>ls $HOME/go/bin</pre>
<p>If all went well, you should see one file listed: <code>claat</code></p>
<p>Now edit your <code>.bashrc</code> file and append the following:</p>
<pre>export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin</pre>
<p>Close then reopen any terminal sessions before running <code>claat</code><br>(alternatively, run the following command to reload <code>.bashrc</code>)</p>
<pre><code>source ~/.bashrc</code></pre>
<p>Then check for the successful installation of <code>claat</code></p>
<pre><code>claat version
or
claat help</code></pre>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Check the path where Go was installed</strong></h3>
<pre>ls /usr/local/go/bin</pre>
<p>If all is well, you should see two files listed: <code>go</code> and <code>gofmt</code></p>
<p>Now edit your <code>.bashrc</code> file and append the following:</p>
<pre>export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin</pre>
<aside class="special"><p>For settings to take effect, it may be necessary to close/reopen <strong>all</strong> command prompt windows</p>
</aside>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Metadata format" duration="5">
        <p>The start of your <code>codelab.doc</code> file needs to have certain metadata, to enable a codelab to function correctly. Some of this metadata is <strong>required</strong> and some is <strong>optional</strong>, as follows:</p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Required metadata</strong></h2>
<p><code>Authors: your_name_here</code><br>At least one name, separated by commas</p>
<p><code>Category: android, kotlin</code><br>At least one category, separated by commas</p>
<p><code>Feedback Link: https://example.com</code><br>The hyperlink to open when &#34;Report a mistake&#34; is clicked at bottom-left</p>
<p><code>URL: how-to-write-a-codelab</code><br>Must be unique within your codelabs directory. This is also<br>used as the folder name where exported files will be created</p>
<p><code>Status: Published</code><br>Valid options: Draft, Published, Deprecated, Hidden</p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Optional metadata</strong></h2>
<p><code>Analytics Account: project-id-123</code><br>This allows you to specify a custom Google Analytics ID for your codelab</p>
<p><code>Environment: Web</code><br>A tag that allows CLaaT to output some codelabs for a specific environment.<br>All codelabs default to the &#34;Web&#34; environment, but given some hardware constraints, you might only want to generate them for a &#34;Kiosk&#34; environment, where you know people will have the right hardware.<br>You can also use this to target specific events, for instance: <code>Web, polymer-summit</code></p>
<p><code>Summary: Create a Codelab in Google Docs</code><br>A short summary of the codelab that will be shown in the codelab browser UI</p>
<p><code>Tags: compose, coroutines</code><br>Add relevant tags to make your codelab easy to find</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Let&#39;s get started!" duration="5">
        <h2 is-upgraded><strong>Metadata and Title</strong></h2>
<p>In the previous section, you learned about codelab metadata, required at the start of each <code>codelab.doc</code> file. Let&#39;s create a new codelab in Google Docs and alter the metadata.</p>
<aside class="special"><p>Tip: after reading the blurb, right-click the link below and select <strong>Open link in new window</strong>. That way, you can view this <em>and</em> that window side-by-side</p>
</aside>
<p>Start by opening the template document in Google Docs ... we&#39;ll be using it to get you started: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vl-oNLzDmDreLeMId9ZcFjIHWVW0RaDAy2BMY7AMbxQ/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">open a copy of the template document read-only</a> (opens in a new tab by default).</p>
<p>With your two browser windows side-by-side, over in the template window, check to see that you are signed in to <em>your</em> Google account. If you are, you&#39;ll see your own avatar at top-right. <strong>If you&#39;re not signed in</strong>, there will be a big blue button saying <strong>Sign in</strong> ... please sign in as you normally would, using the Google account that you&#39;ll use to author your codelabs, then you should be returned to the original template document</p>
<aside class="warning"><p>Note: if you see <em>another</em> user&#39;s avatar near the center of the Google Docs toolbar, just ignore it<br>... it simply means that another person is viewing the <em>same</em> template at the same time.</p>
<p>This will change once you save a copy to your Google Drive, as the new file will belong to <em>you</em></p>
</aside>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Save a copy to your Google Drive</strong></h3>
<aside class="special"><p>Tip: go to your <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive" target="_blank">Google Drive</a> <em>first</em> and create a <strong>New folder</strong> for your Codelab projects. Then you can keep all your <code>codelab.doc</code> files together in one place, <em>and</em> it will make the next step easier</p>
</aside>
<p>In the top-left corner, click the <code>File</code> menu, then select <code>Make a copy</code> ... you will be presented with a <strong>Copy document</strong> dialog asking for a new document <strong>Name</strong> (required), and in which <strong>Folder</strong> to store it (optional).</p>
<p>Name it <strong>My First Codelab</strong>  ... this is a similar name to the &#34;<code>URL</code>&#34; metadata we&#39;ll be using soon, just to keep things simple for this tutorial. Follow <strong>one</strong> of these steps regarding file location:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you do <strong>not</strong> wish to worry about folders, then simply select the <strong>Make a copy</strong> button</li>
<li>If you <strong>do</strong> wish to select the file location and you <strong>did</strong> create a folder earlier, under <strong>Folder</strong>, click the <strong>My Drive</strong> button and <strong>select the folder</strong> you created previously, then click the <strong>Select</strong> button</li>
<li>If you <strong>did not create a new folder</strong> previously, <strong>but you wish to do so</strong> now, select the <strong>All locations</strong> tab at the top of the dialog. Hover your mouse cursor over the <strong>My Drive</strong> (or other) listing, and click the arrow (<strong>˃</strong>) at far right. Wait for your files/folders to load, then in the bottom-left corner, you&#39;ll see a <strong>New folder</strong> icon. Click that button and type in a meaningful name, e.g. <strong>My Codelabs</strong> ... you will then be presented with an empty folder. Now you can click the <strong>Select</strong> button</li>
</ul>
<h4 is-upgraded><strong>Sample folder/file hierarchy</strong>:</h4>
<p>My Drive<br>|— My Codelabs<br>|—|— My first Codelab</p>
<pre>From here on, we will refer to your new file as the &#34;exercises codelab&#34;.
Instructions for you to follow-along-with will appear in boxes like this</pre>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Codelab Title</strong></h3>
<p>Your codelab&#39;s title is actually formatted in the <strong>Title</strong> style. Place your mouse cursor somewhere within your new template document&#39;s title <strong>Create a Codelab in Google Docs</strong> and you&#39;ll see <strong>Title</strong> in the format toolbar, instead of <strong>Normal text</strong>.</p>
<p>To <em>safely</em> highlight the template&#39;s title, place your mouse cursor at the <em>end</em> of the row, then on your keyboard, press the <code>Shift</code> + <code>Home</code> keys simultaneously. This ensures that the hidden line-break character is <strong>not</strong> included in the selection</p>
<aside class="special"><p>Tip: when selecting text, especially the <strong>entire</strong> row, take care <strong>not</strong> to select the <strong>hidden</strong> line break character, located at the end of each line, <em>unless</em> you actually intend to do so. However, there <em>are</em> cases where you <em>would</em> need to include it, just not today. This tip applies to <em>all</em> word processors</p>
</aside>
<p>Now start typing your <em>own</em> title to personalize your codelab, e.g. <strong>My First Codelab</strong></p>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Codelab Metadata</strong></h3>
<p>This metadata should be added as a <strong>two-column table</strong> anywhere before the first step of the codelab.</p>
<p>With your template document visible, compare its metadata, at the top of the file, with this example:</p>
<table>
<tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Summary</p>
</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>My first Codelab using Google Docs</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>URL</p>
</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>my-first-docs-codelab</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Category</p>
</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>codelabs</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Environment</p>
</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>web</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Status</p>
</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Draft</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Feedback Link</p>
</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;username&gt;.github.io/issues</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Author</p>
</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Your Name</p>
</td></tr>
</table>
<aside class="warning"><p>Important: if you are creating <em>multiple</em> codelabs, it is imperative that the first thing you <strong>change</strong> in the <strong>metadata</strong> is the &#34;URL&#34; field. This name is used when creating the sub-folder in which the exported HTML is saved. If you have two or more codelabs with the <em>same</em> name, they may be overwritten upon export, without warning! Also, in <em>all</em> cases within this tutorial, please substitute <strong>&lt;username&gt; </strong>(including angle brackets) with <em>your </em><strong>Computer</strong> or <strong>GitHub</strong> username, as applicable</p>
</aside>
<pre>Edit the metadata for your exercises codelab, to suit you. Remember
the guidelines though, as incorrectly formatted metadata may lead to
a build failure, malformed codelab markup, or unexpected behavior!</pre>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Headers/exporting" duration="4">
        <aside class="special"><p><strong>Title </strong>in this context, refers to your exported codelab&#39;s <code>index.html</code> document title, <em>not</em> your <code>codelab.doc</code> filename at the very top-left of Google Docs.</p>
<p>The export instructions are added here, in the <em>middle</em> of the tutorial, because you now have some <em>actual</em> content to <code>export</code> ... it will help to give you an idea of what <code>output</code> to expect, based on the <code>input</code> that you provide. We will cover Exporting below</p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Headers</strong></h2>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Title/headings/heading levels</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Title</strong>: as previously mentioned, <strong>Title</strong> is reserved for the overall <strong>document title</strong>, in <em>this</em> case &#34;Create a Codelab in Google Docs&#34; as shown on this browser&#39;s tab, and in the top left-hand corner.<br>It would also show on the <strong>landing page</strong> ... we cover landing pages in <a href="https://mikaere66.github.io" target="_blank">another codelab</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Heading 1</strong>: every codelab document must use the <strong>Heading 1</strong> paragraph style to delineate the steps of the codelab. In turn, these headings will be used to automatically create a <strong>Table of Contents</strong> that shows the student exactly where they are in the codelab, in <em>this</em> case &#34;Headers/exporting&#34;, and allows them to jump to any step.<br>The table of contents disappears for <em>smaller</em> browser windows, but is still available from the hamburger menu.</p>
<p><strong>Headings 2..4</strong> have no overall bearing on the codelab itself (except Code blocks ... more on them later). Headings 2..4 are simply used to organize your content, similar to any <em>other</em> well-formatted Google Docs document. These headings will get translated to <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code> tags in the codelab markup</p>
<pre>Edit the headers in your exercises codelab to reflect some things that
you have an interest in. Try adding your own, using correct formatting</pre>
<h2 is-upgraded>Exporting</h2>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>How to Export your Codelab</strong></h3>
<p>Now it&#39;s time to create some actual output from your &#34;exercises codelab&#34; document ... start by deciding <strong>where on your computer</strong> you&#39;d like to store your project files.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s say that you have a directory named <code>Projects</code> under your <code>Home</code> folder.</p>
<p>The CLaaT tool &#34;exports&#34; your HTML files to the &#34;<code>url</code>&#34; suffix specified in the <code>metadata</code> you edited earlier ... for this example, we will use <code>how-to-write-a-codelab</code></p>
<h4 is-upgraded><strong>Sample folder hierarchy</strong>:</h4>
<p>Home<br>|— Projects<br>|—|— <strong>how-to-write-a-codelab<br></strong>|—|—|— <strong>img</strong></p>
<p>The two folders in <strong>bold</strong> are created/updated by the CLaaT tool upon &#34;exporting&#34; your codelab.</p>
<p>Open a <strong>command prompt</strong> or <strong>terminal</strong> window in your <code>Projects</code> folder, and run this command, or more-succinctly, a variation thereof:</p>
<pre>claat export 12ABC3DEFGHIJ456K7LMNOPQRS-TUVWXYZ890ABC1244
(do not copy)</pre>
<aside class="special"><p>Note: the specified <em>document ID</em> is totally <em>fictitious</em>. Please <strong>substitute with your own</strong> 44 character document ID. Your doc ID can be found after <strong>docs.google.com/document/d/</strong> and before the <strong>/edit?tab=t.0</strong> portion in the address bar URL for <em>your</em> exercises codelab</p>
</aside>
<aside class="warning"><p>Important: if this is your first time accessing <em>any</em> Google service via the command-line, then you may get a prompt saying <strong>Authorize me at following URL</strong> ... if so, copy/paste the URL into your browser and sign in using the same Google account that you&#39;ll use to author your codelabs. This is a security feature, similar to any you might run into while attempting to access your Google Docs documents in a web browser, for example. You will see this prompt only once</p>
</aside>
<p>If the <code>export</code> command was successful, you should receive a confirmation in the form:</p>
<pre>ok        how-to-write-a-codelab</pre>
<p>The <code>how-to-write-a-codelab</code> portion indicates the name of your newly created codelab folder. Open your file manager application, and explore the contents ... you can open the <code>.json</code> and <code>.html</code> files in a plain-text editor and peruse the output, but <strong>do not edit</strong> these files, as their contents are overwritten <em>every</em> time you run <code>claat export ...</code><br></p>
<p>Note the random filenames in the <code>img</code> sub-folder ... these are generated by the CLaaT tool, and are named as such for security purposes</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Preview your codelab" duration="0">
        <p>There are many ways you can preview your codelab while in the development phase:</p>
<ul>
<li>CLaaT tool (local)</li>
<li>Direct link (manual)</li>
<li>My Drive menu (auto)</li>
<li>Chrome/Edge extension</li>
<li>Gulp (mentioned, but not covered here)</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>CLaaT Tool</strong></h2>
<p>In the previous section, you exported your first codelab ... let&#39;s preview it locally using the CLaaT tool. To do that, open a <strong>second</strong> terminal window in the newly-created <code>how-to-write-a-codelab</code> folder and run the command:</p>
<pre><code>claat serve</code></pre>
<p>This will start a temporary <em>local</em> web server instance, and open a <em>new</em> browser tab to the local server instance (<code>http://localhost:9090</code> by default) displaying your new codelab web page.</p>
<p>Optional: the <code>claat serve</code> command accepts a <code>-addr host:port</code> option, to specify the desired hostname or IP address and port number to bind to.</p>
<p>It <em>is</em> possible to keep the <code>claat serve</code> instance running, and continue to run <code>claat export</code> in the <em>first</em> terminal window. This will save you from having to constantly switch directories to run each command in turn</p>
<p>Back in your <code>claat serve</code> terminal window, when you&#39;re ready to <strong>quit</strong> the web server instance, press <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>C</code> simultaneously while that window has focus.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Direct Link</h2>
<p>The manual method starts with opening a new <code>plain-text</code> document on your computer that you can save and refer to later:</p>
<p>You just need to paste into that text file two things:</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>the preview URL</li>
<li>the document ID</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Preview URL</strong>:<br>Start by copying/pasting this URL prefix (including the equals sign):</p>
<pre>https://codelabs-preview.appspot.com/?file_id=</pre>
<p><strong>Your Doc ID</strong>:<br>Your document ID can be found after <strong>docs.google.com/document/d/</strong> and before the <strong>/edit?tab=t.0</strong> portion in the address bar URL for <em>your</em> exercises codelab, e.g.</p>
<pre>12ABC3DEFGHIJ456K7LMNOPQRS-TUVWXYZ890ABC1244
(do not copy)</pre>

      <google-codelab-step label="Duration and time" duration="1">
        <p>Some students are not <em>fully</em> committed to completing a codelab when they first start out. One of the ways that you can keep them engaged is by giving them accurate estimates, at each step, regarding how much <em>additional</em> effort is required to complete the codelab.</p>
<p>In order to add this feature to your codelab, each section needs to have an estimated <strong>time to complete</strong>, in the form <code>Duration: MM:SS</code> <strong>or </strong><code>Duration: H:MM:SS</code> and it should be placed on the line immediately following the section header. Annotate the text with the color <strong>dark grey 1 </strong>(in the toolbar&#39;s color palette, it&#39;s 5th from the left).</p>
<p>Sample formatting for <em>this</em> section:</p>
<pre>&lt;H1&gt;Duration and Time&lt;H1&gt;
&lt;FONT color=&#34;dark grey 1&#34;&gt;</pre>
<aside class="warning"><p>The example above is <strong>conceptual</strong> only, and is intended to demonstrate the use of <strong>headings</strong> and <strong>colors</strong> for this particular section in the tutorial</p>
</aside>
<p>The total duration for all sections is calculated automatically by the CLaaT tool when a codelab is &#34;exported&#34; ... it appears at the beginning of all codelabs, opposite the codelab&#39;s title, where you&#39;ll see a timer icon followed by the total time remaining. This time estimate is also used for each codelab on the &#34;landing page&#34;, if applicable.</p>
<p>As the student progresses through each section in the codelab, the estimated time changes to reflect actual time remaining for those sections <em>not-yet</em> completed</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seconds are <strong>ignored</strong> ... in other words, only whole minutes are tabulated/displayed</li>
<li>If you <strong>forget</strong> to add the duration for a section, the default of 1:00 minute will be used</li>
<li>If only <strong>one</strong> colon is used (<code>M:SS</code>), then that duration is assumed to be minutes:seconds</li>
<li>If the <strong>last</strong> section of your codelab is simply a <code>Congratulations</code> or <code>Summary</code> page, you should set the duration for that section to zero (0:00)</li>
</ul>
<pre>Alter some of the Duration annotations in your exercises codelab. Get
the total for all the annotations, and after exporting your codelab,
go to the first section and compare that to what&#39;s shown at top-right</pre>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Lists/special formats" duration="4">
        <h2 is-upgraded><strong>Bullets/Numbering</strong></h2>
<p>Bulleted and numbered <strong>lists</strong> are created just the same way as with authoring any well-formatted Google Docs document. Start by entering a list of items <em>without</em> any formatting, adding each list-item on a <em>new</em> line, plus a new <em>empty</em> line at the end of the list.</p>
<p>When you&#39;re ready, highlight all items in the list (but not the final <em>empty</em> line) then on the toolbar, select either <strong>Bulleted list</strong> or <strong>Numbered list</strong></p>
<pre>Make your own bulleted and/or numbered list(s) in the exercises codelab,
whatever suits you. Check its HTML output after running claat export ...</pre>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Info Boxes</strong></h2>
<p>Info boxes are colored callouts that enclose special information in codelabs. Positive info boxes should contain positive information like best practices and time-saving tips. Negative info boxes should contain information like API usage restrictions or warnings.</p>
<p>How to create Info boxes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Positive information, like best practices and time saving tips, should be formatted as a <strong>single-cell table</strong> with a <strong>light green 3</strong> background</li>
<li>Negative information, like warnings and API usage restrictions, should be formatted as a <strong>single-cell table</strong> with a <strong>light orange 3</strong> background</li>
</ul>
<p>It is recommended that you keep your infoboxes clean, concise and focused on a single topic. If you have information which may be useful to know but is not a critical part of the codelab instructions, then you should link to that information from the FAQ section rather than including it as an infobox.</p>
<table>
<tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><strong>Table properties: positive info box</strong></p>
</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><strong>Table properties: negative info box</strong></p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="image-container"><img alt="Cell background: light green 3" style="width: 298.00px" src="img/1fcb2fcedf4100f6.png"></p>

</td></tr>
</table>
<pre>Add your own info boxes (from scratch) to your exercises codelab ...
start by placing the text-cursor at the desired location, then from
the Insert menu, select Table | 1x1 ... now enter some text appropriate
to this info box&#39;s use-case. To format the color, right-click the
table and about three-quarters of the way down the menu, select &#34;Table
properties&#34; ... expand the 〉Color category near the bottom, then
change &#34;Cell background color&#34; to the correct color for your use-case.
Remember: &#34;light green 3&#34; for positive, &#34;light orange 3&#34; for negative</pre>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Code Blocks</strong></h2>
<p>So far, in this tutorial, we&#39;ve been outlining exercises for you to complete in special &#34;boxes&#34; ... these boxes are actually intended for &#34;command-line snippets&#34;, but have been used in <em>this</em> case to highlight instructions for you to follow.</p>
<p>It&#39;s often the case that you will have command-line instructions or log messages which are formatted with a <code>monospaced</code> font and have pre-defined whitespace. You can add these sections to your codelab by creating a <strong>single-cell table</strong> and making sure that all the text within the table is formatted using the <strong>Consolas font</strong> ... in a way, these code blocks are similar to info boxes, but instead of a color background, you use a special font.</p>
<aside class="special"><p>To format text with the <strong>Consolas</strong> font, unless you&#39;ve used it before in Google Docs, you&#39;ll need to specifically add it from the <strong>More fonts</strong> section. Highlight the desired text, then click the drop-down <strong>Font</strong> menu and select <code>More fonts</code> ... in the dialog box, start typing <code>Consolas</code> in the search field and Consolas should show within the list section. Click the <code>Consolas</code> entry once to select it, then click the <code>OK</code> button.<br>Next time you need Consolas, you&#39;ll find it in the regular Font menu, along with Roboto, etc.</p>
</aside>
<pre>Try adding your own Command-line Snippet to the exercises codelab.
Remember to format the included text with the correct font. This is
how the CLaaT tool recognizes code blocks &amp; outputs correct markup</pre>
<p>Do you see a pattern emerging, in how the CLaaT tool recognizes key features <strong>formatted in a particular style</strong>, so that it can convert them to special markup for your codelab&#39;s HTML output?</p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Code Snippets</strong></h2>
<pre><code>Code snippets with syntax highlighting can be added
by creating a single-cell table and making sure that
all the text is formatted using the Courier New font</code></pre>
<p>Notice in the example directly above, that certain keywords (from different programming languages) are highlighted in different colors. Both of these blocks are <strong>single-cell</strong> tables, but the first one is formatted using the <strong>Consolas</strong> font, whereas the second is formatted using the <strong>Courier New</strong> font.</p>
<aside class="warning"><p>Note: in the three <strong>code block</strong>/<strong>code snippet</strong> boxes above, each and every line (except the last line) in each box has a hard-coded <strong>line break</strong>, otherwise the code would scroll far off-screen to the right, which is not the desired effect. <em>This</em> particular box however, has <em>no</em> line breaks whatsoever, because it&#39;s an <em>info box</em>, not a code block. Also, notice that we&#39;re allowed to have <strong>bold</strong>/<em>italicized</em> text here, whereas <em>any/all</em> text formatting within a <strong>code block</strong> or <strong>code snippet</strong> is categorically ignored, <em>except</em> the <strong>Consolas</strong>/<strong>Courier New</strong> fonts</p>
</aside>
<p>Any additional styles applied to the code will be overridden by the syntax highlighting. This means that you&#39;re free to use code highlighting Add-ons in your <code>codelab.doc</code> but it will have <em>no</em> effect on how the code is highlighted in the final codelab.</p>
<p>For programming tutorials, it is strongly recommended that you provide a <strong>Heading 3</strong> header directly above your code snippet with the <strong>filename</strong>, if appropriate. This helps students keep track of where the code is coming from. The codelab framework uses the <em>file extension</em> of that Heading 3 header as a clue for how to highlight the code.</p>
<p>It is also strongly recommended that you make your <strong>Heading 3</strong> header a hyperlink to the actual file, if it is available on GitHub. A leading GitHub icon will automatically be added to the heading in such cases.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Text Styles</strong></h2>
<p>Apart from special use-cases already mentioned, for the most part, it doesn&#39;t matter which fonts you use in your Google Doc draft, because <em>everything</em> will be formatted using <strong>Roboto</strong> in the final codelab.</p>
<p>However, there <em>are</em> some simple methods that you can use to add emphasis to certain parts of the text. <strong>Bolded</strong> and <em>italicized</em> text will be passed through to the codelab markup as <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tags respectively. Also, passages of text formatted with the <code>Courier New</code> font will be passed through as inline <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tags in the markup.</p>
<p>You might have to experiment with line breaks to get your pages looking just right. Also, while you can use <em>some</em> regular HTML, be aware that left and right angle brackets are special characters in markup, so in the above paragraph, we&#39;ve had to use <strong>&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;</strong> (<em>without</em> the <strong>bold</strong>) to demonstrate <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> correctly, for example.</p>
<p>Something else worth noting is that technically &#34;line breaks&#34; and &#34;new paragraphs&#34; are two  different things. Normally, in a Google Docs document, when you press the <code>Enter</code> key, you&#39;ll get a <strong>new paragraph</strong>, so when your codelab is exported to markup, it&#39;s translated to <code>&lt;P&gt;</code> ... however, you may notice that there&#39;s a small gap between paragraphs.<br>If you&#39;d like a new line, but want to avoid the gap (as demonstrated by <em>this</em> new line) then press <code>Shift</code> + <code>Enter</code> instead. This creates a <strong>line break</strong> that is translated to <code>&lt;BR&gt;</code> in your HTML output</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Images and videos" duration="0">
        <h2 is-upgraded><strong>Responsive images</strong></h2>
<p>Adding images to your codelab is just the same as adding images to a regular Google Docs document.</p>
<p>Start by positioning the text-cursor at the desired location, then from the <strong>Insert</strong> menu, select <code>Image</code> ... you&#39;ll see a pop-out menu containing the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upload from computer</li>
<li>Search the web</li>
<li>Drive</li>
<li>Photos</li>
<li>Camera</li>
<li>By URL</li>
</ul>
<p>Select the preferred method, then the image will be inserted and saved &#34;within&#34; the document itself, even when the <strong>By URL</strong> option is used. That way, your images will always be available, and not reliant on someone else&#39;s website.</p>
<p>For images, <strong>Alt text</strong> helps with accessibility, as well as showing up if (for some reason) the image fails to load, or the viewer has images turned off.</p>
<p>To add <strong>Alt text</strong> for an image, right-click the image and select <strong>Alt Text</strong>. In the pop-out menu that shows on the right-hand edge of Google Docs, <strong>Alt text</strong> is at the bottom.<br><strong>Keyboard shortcut</strong> for Alt text is: <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>Alt</code> + <code>Y</code> <em>after</em> clicking the image once to highlight it.</p>
<p>A <strong>title</strong> tag can also be added to an image, which will show as a &#34;tooltip&#34; when the mouse-cursor is hovered over the image. After added your &#34;Alt text&#34;, click the <code>Advanced options</code> link to also add a &#34;title&#34; tag.</p>
<aside class="special"><p>Note: after running the <code>claat export ...</code> command, images are saved to your local computer, within the <strong>img</strong> folder under the codelab&#39;s output directory, in our case: <strong>my-first-docs-codelab/img</strong></p>
</aside>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Image sample" title="Image sample" style="width: 624.00px" src="img/afb216d18c40e4a7.jpeg"></p>
<p><strong>Task</strong>:</p>
<p>Search on Google (or whatever) for something that you have an interest in, then flip to the Images tab.</p>
<p>Find something of medium size, i.e. the example above is 924x601 pixels ... if too big, you&#39;ll find that the image is actually downsized (if required) to match the <em>width</em> of the codelab&#39;s <em>main</em> section (this).</p>
<p>For example, try dragging the right-hand edge of this window in and out to see how the image resizes (tip: when done, press <code>ESC</code> while <em>still holding the mouse button</em>, to restore the window&#39;s original size)</p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Youtube videos</strong></h2>
<p>Youtube videos can be embedded by following these simple steps:</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Add an image in the desired location within the document, as outlined above. The image can be a screenshot of the video (thumbnail) for instance, but it doesn&#39;t really matter since it won&#39;t be displayed, but instead, replaced by the embedded video</li>
<li>Take the same steps (as for images) to add &#34;Alt Text&#34; by first clicking the image to make it &#34;active&#34;, and doing the <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>Alt</code> + <code>Y</code> thing</li>
<li>However, this time, instead of typing in some &#34;Alt text&#34;, paste a YouTube video link in the Description field of the Alt text, in the format <code>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWAinkJ54AP8</code> where <code>DWAinkJ54AP8</code> is the video ID in this sample URL</li>
</ol>
<iframe class="youtube-video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DWAinkJ54AP8?rel=0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<aside class="warning"><p>Although the video URL used in this example is formatted correctly, it is no longer valid, as the video has been removed from YouTube ... the use of an <em>invalid</em> video ID was <em>by design</em>, for the purpose of demonstration only</p>
</aside>
<p><strong>Task</strong>:</p>
<p>Try adding a video to your exercises codelab, by first inserting an image, then adding a YouTube url as the Alt text</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Buttons and iFrames" duration="3">
        <h2 is-upgraded><strong>How to add a Button</strong></h2>
<p>In order to add a button to your codelab, simply add a hyperlink to some text, and make sure that the text is <strong>highlighted</strong> with a <strong>dark green 1</strong> background (note the distinction between text <em>color</em> and background <em>highlighting</em>). The link for the example button below actually points to <strong>example.com</strong> and will open that website in a <strong>new tab</strong> by default, but a link to a file download will work just the same way.</p>

<pre>Add a button to your exercises codelab using the correct Highlight color</pre>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>How to add an iFrame</strong></h2>
<p>Aaah no, iFrames are not a new type of eyewear from Apple ... an inline frame (or iFrame) is a special HTML element that loads <em>another</em> HTML page in <em>your</em> HTML document. It essentially puts another webpage <em>within</em> the parent page.</p>
<p>You can add an iFrame by following these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add an image in the document. The image can be a screenshot of the iFrame (thumbnail) for instance, but it doesn&#39;t really matter since it won&#39;t be displayed, but instead replaced by the embedded iFrame</li>
<li>Take the same steps (as for images) to add &#34;Alt Text&#34; by first clicking the image to make it &#34;active&#34;, and doing the <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>Alt</code> + <code>Y</code> thing</li>
<li>As with videos, instead of typing in some &#34;Alt text&#34;, paste a full URL in the Description field of the Alt text, which in this example is <code>https://codepen.io/tzoght/embed/yRNZaP</code></li>
</ul>
<iframe class="embedded-iframe" src="https://codepen.io/tzoght/embed/yRNZaP"></iframe>

<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Full-on code blocks</strong></h3>
<p>(single-cell table req&#39;d)</p>
<ul>
<li>Console output (no Highlighting): <strong>all</strong> formatted as <code>Consolas</code> font</li>
<li>Code snippets (<strong>with</strong> Highlighting): <strong>all</strong> formatted as <code>Courier New</code></li>
</ul>
<aside class="special"><p>Tip: an easy way to remember these is to think about them in terms of <em>how</em> the <code>Consolas</code> listing is <em>worded</em> ... <code>Terminal</code> or <code>Console</code> output should use the <code>Consolas</code> font. Also, the fact that <code>Courier New</code> is used for syntax highlighting <strong>and </strong><code>&lt;code&gt;</code> snippets (below) is trivial</p>
</aside>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Simple font/text color</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Section header only: must be <strong>Heading 1</strong></li>
<li>Duration text color: <strong>dark grey 1</strong> (fifth from the left)<br>and must be on the next line after <strong>Section</strong> header</li>
<li>Simple <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> snippets: <code>Courier New</code> font</li>
<li>Actually displaying <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> in the line above:<br>&amp;lt;code&amp;gt; formatted as <code>Courier New</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Buttons</strong></h3>
<p>Add a hyperlink to some text, and make sure that the text is <strong>highlighted</strong> with a <strong>dark green 1</strong> background (remember, on the toolbar, select <strong>Highlight color</strong>, <em>not</em> Text color)</p>
